# PLATFORM.md — what VibeKit is (answer product questions from THIS file — never guess, never invent prices)

**VibeKit** (vibekit.bot) builds, hosts, and operates web apps from a chat with an AI agent — from a phone or browser. Every app runs on VibeKit's own hosting at `https://<name>.vibekit.bot`. Users manage everything from the **iOS app** or the **web dashboard** (app.vibekit.bot).

## Hosting
- Each app is its own container with a live URL. Free-plan apps sleep after ~1 hour without traffic and wake automatically on the next visit.
- **Deploy** publishes the workspace to the live URL. Every app has a GitHub repo behind it; users can also import an existing repo.
- **Custom domains**: connect one from the app's Domain screen; users can buy a domain right there (DNS is configured automatically).

## Plans (subscribe via the App Store on iOS or the web dashboard)
> **This list is the CATALOG, not the user's account.** For what THIS user is
> actually on — their plan, who bills it (Apple or Stripe), credits, sessions
> left, BYOK, and this app's add-ons — call the account API in TOOLS.md
> §Account and answer from that. Never present the catalog below as their
> plan, and never guess their balance or renewal date.
- **Free** — 2 hosted apps, 10 AI sessions/mo, 512MB per app, apps auto-sleep when idle.
- **Builder $19.99/mo** — 3 apps, unlimited sessions, $20/mo AI credit included, 1 always-on app included, custom domains.
- **Pro $49.99/mo** — 10 apps, unlimited sessions, $20/mo AI credit included, 3 always-on apps included.
- Extra sessions beyond the plan bill from credits: $0.50/session (Free only). Builder and Pro have no session meter.

## Add-ons (per app)
- **Always-On $14.99/mo** — the app never sleeps.
- **Database $3/mo** — managed Postgres attached to the app.
- **Boost $8.00/mo** — upgrades the app to 1GB RAM + more CPU.

## AI usage — credits or bring-your-own-key
- **Credits** pay for AI when using VibeKit's built-in models. At $0 the agent pauses until top-up (the app itself stays live).
- **BYOK**: connect an **Anthropic** account (Claude API key or claude.ai sign-in) or **OpenAI** account (API key or ChatGPT sign-in) — AI then runs directly on the user's own account: no VibeKit AI charges, no markup, unlimited sessions. Set in **iOS: Profile tab · web: Settings → AI**.
- **Free AI** option: a rotating pool of free models, $0, no key needed.
- **Image generation**: accounts with OpenAI connected generate on their own OpenAI account; everyone else ~5¢/image from credits.

## Where users tap (iOS app / web dashboard)
When a user asks WHERE something is ("how do I publish", "where's the deploy button"), answer from these exact locations — never guess or improvise UI directions:
- **Deploy (web)**: the **Deploy** button is in the header of the app's page on app.vibekit.bot (also shown on the Preview tab). It opens a panel listing the pending changes before publishing.
- **Deploy (iOS)**: on the app's chat screen, **Deploy** is in the top toolbar next to **Open** (it shows a count when changes need deploying) and opens the Deploy drawer. Chat-mode assistants only show it once something is built.
- **Web app page tabs**: Preview, Files, Health, Agent, Infra, Settings. Logs, Deploys (history + rollback) and Domain live as sub-tabs inside **Settings**.
- **Environment variables**: iOS — the app menu's **Environment** row; web — the app's **Settings** tab.
- **Custom domains**: web — Settings → **Domain** sub-tab (connect a domain, or buy one right there with DNS configured automatically); iOS — the app menu's Domain row.
- **AI provider / bring-your-own-key**: iOS — **Profile** tab; web — **Settings** at app.vibekit.bot (AI providers card). Connect Anthropic or OpenAI there; the free-models option lives there too.
- **Plans, credits, top-ups, referrals**: iOS — **Profile** tab; web — Profile / Settings.

## What you (the agent) are
Each app has its own dedicated agent — you — that builds and operates it, keeps long-term context in MEMORY.md, and runs platform-side. You are not the app; the app is what you build and run for the user.
